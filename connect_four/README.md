# The Odin Project - Connect Four

**Connect Four** is a game in which the players choose a *color* and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid.
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the *lowest available space* within the column.

The objective of the game is to be the first to form a *horizontal*, *vertical*, or *diagonal* line of four of one's own tokens.

## Objective

To experience in writing code with `TDD`.
