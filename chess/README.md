# The Odin Project - Chess

**Chess** is a *board game* for two players.
It is sometimes called **International chess** or **Western chess** to distinguish it from related games such as *xiangqi* (Chinese chess) and *shogi* (Japanese chess).

The objective of the game is to **checkmate** (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king. There are also several ways a game can end in a *draw*.

This is a **CLI based chess**, where you need to enter the *origin square* & *destination square* to make the move.

## Objective

This was done as part of [The Odin Project's final ruby project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-ruby-final-project).

## Features

Most of the [chess rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess) has been implemented in this application.

- **Check mate** will be detected as it's a winning rule.
- *Quitting* the game will be considered as **Resigning** and the *win* goes to the other player.
- **Stale mate**, **Three-fold repetition**, **Fifty-move rule** will be detected & declare it as a *tie*.
- Movements such as **En passant**, **Castling**, **Pawn promotion** has been implemented.
- **Simple AI** that can make *move* and *capture*.
- **Save** the game & *reload* the saved game whenever you can.
