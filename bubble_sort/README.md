# The Odin Project - Bubble Sort

This sorting method is known as **"Bubble Sort"**, and also sometimes referred as **"Sinking Sort"**.

It is a simple sorting algorithm, where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right.
This continues until the array is eventually sorted.

The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements ***"bubble"*** up to the top of the list.
