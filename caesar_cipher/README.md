# The Odin Project - Caesar Cipher

It's an **encryption** method where the corresponding character is replaced with a character from a fixed number of position.

## Usage

For example character **'A'** is replaced with **'C'** if the shift position is **2**.
**'WxYz'** is replaced with **'BcDe'** if the shift position is **5**.

**Spaces** and **Symbols** won't be replaced and will be returned the same.
